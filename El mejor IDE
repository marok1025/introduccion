I already answered this question, many a times. 
But, again...

I won't use an IDE. I would prefer an editor...Sublime Text 2 Editor. 
Not just me, but many professional prefer editors such as vim, sublime Text 2/3, Notepad++, ...to IDEs. 

It's recommended for the beginners to work with IDEs, to go through all the features....But, in a long run, it would be better to prefer an Editor. 

The reason is all the popular editors are providing the features provided with the IDEs, with add-ons. Also, Editors are light-weight compared to IDEs.

If you are a beginner, i recommend you to work on IDEs. 
In commercial versions, i recommend Komodo IDE and PyCharm IDE.
In community (free) versions, i recommend Spyder IDE and PyCharm IDE.
IDLE is basic IDE provided by python software foundation.

In fact, Spyder IDE is google's Recommendation. It comes part of the python(x,y)  python distribution from Google.
